///! This module defines

/// can appear in [Word::keyword]:
///    pub const KEYWORD = "KEYWORD"
/// 2) an `ALL_KEYWORDS` array with every keyword in it
///     This is not a list of *reserved* keywords: some of these can be
///     parsed as identifiers if the parser decides so. This means that
///     new keywords can be added here without affecting the parse result.
///
///     As a matter of fact, most of these keywords are not used at all
///     and could be removed.
/// 3) a `RESERVED_FOR_TABLE_ALIAS` array with keywords reserved in a
/// "table alias" context.

/// Defines a string constant for a single keyword: `kw_def!(SELECT);`
/// expands to `pub const SELECT = "SELECT";`
